## Currently Learning (for what)

### [[CPP]]

- Learning it for solving [[DSA-Problems]]. 
- Also the fact that is similar to C.

### [[py.python|python]]

- First programming language that I have learned.
- The one most comfortable with.
- I know they break readability but oh god, do I love [[py.oneliners]].

### [[JS]]

- The modern web is bloated with JS. I hate this. But it is also what makes most of web possible.
- Gotta understand [this mess.](https://i.imgur.com/k5gpVwh.png)

### [[Liquid]]

- For [[Jekyll]] for https://notes.whoibrar.com

### [[Java]]

- Not actively learning, picked up some from people around me.

## Not  Programming 

### [[HTML]] & [[CSS]]

- Figuring out [[WebDev]]

### [[Markdown]]

- Everything I write is almost every time in markdown, I know it isn't but it can be considered plain text.


## Want to Learn (also why)

### [[Rust]] 

- *It has no garbage collector and its awesome!*
	- Heard that sentence many times but did make much sense. Later I watched video titled [Rust makes you feel like a GENIUS - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJ94rbdteE) and it did a great job of introducing Borrow Checker
	- Borrow Checker has two rules for Data
		- One owner 
		- Multiple Readers and Single Writer 
	- Also the fact that it can achieve near C speeds.

### [[Ruby]] 

- I did care about the language, it until I found about the Lucy Stiff and book [Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide/book/chapter-3.html), will definitely want to finish that book sometime. 

### [[Lisp]]

- [The Roots of Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html) suggests that lips has taken a different turn from C family.
- Its [programmable programming language](https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2019/06/22/what-is-a-programmable-programming-language/) aka Metaprogramming 
- Its has cool - sexy name. Also a decent Logo. 

## Programming 101
- Programming is about 
	- Data analysis
	- Data Transformation
	- Data Generation

- Fundamentals of Every Programming Language
	- Operations
		- Types : Arithmetic, Logic etc
		- Usually give a single output for two inputs
		- Generally, generate new value rather than mutating existing 
	- Variables
	- Branching
	- Looping
	- Functions
	- Input / Output

- Program is set of functions 
	- any function can call any other
	- no code exists outside of functions
	- execution begins by calling `main` function
	- variables of function exist only in that function

- System Calls
	- capabilities exposed by Operating system for program management and i/o.
	- Invoked by hardware mechanism (CPU instruction)
	- Invoked in most languages by special functions

- Metaprogramming	-> [source](https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2019/06/22/what-is-a-programmable-programming-language/#:~:text=metaprogramming%20allows%20us%20to%20extend%20a%20language%20with%20new%20features%20by%20defining%20how%20the%20written%20source%20code%20is%20to%20be%20transformed%20into%20a%20more%20low-level%20code.)
	- What is it 
		- Metaprogramming allows us to extend a language with new features by defining how the written source code is to be transformed into a more low-level code. 
		- These extensions can be big new language feature like support for object-oriented programming, or small domain-specific extension which would be too specific to be included in the standard.

## More Terms 

- Why is it Called Bugs
	- Origins from when [[computing.analog|Analog Computing]] was used and there were real bugs stopping the program from running or causing other issues
- Code Smell 
	- When the program doesn't particularly give an error but it still indicates a deeper problem with the code
- Unreachable Code
	- Basically, code that will never be reached
- Dead Code
	- Code whose results are not used even if it is executed.
